When I first began my rabbit-hole into color theory, I expected to mostly read articles that said things like, “red is for anger and warnings, blue is for sadness and business, and green is for money and growth.” 

And I did. 

But I also read some really useful techniques for [building harmonious palettes](https://dribbble.com/shots/166246-My-Secret-for-Color-Schemes) and [mixing colors in code with Sass](https://alistapart.com/article/mixing-color-for-the-web-with-sass/).  

And I’m adding a project to the list that involves using [divisionist techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisionism) to digitally paint a masterpiece (either by code or by Photoshop brush).  

Overall, I’ve found color theory to be deep and dense and fascinating. For now, however, my only goal is to build a simple color palette for a new website project I’m tackling. 

Luckily, I discovered [a really simple color workflow](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) that designer Laura Elizabeth (founder of [DesignAcademy.io](https://www.designacademy.io/)) wrote up for Smashing Magazine. 

There are only 3 broad steps:

1. Choose a base color
2. Choose an accent color
3. Blend up a few harmonious neutrals

Since my client already has a dual-colored logo, I don’t have to do any of the work to choose the base and accent colors. Here's my palette so far:

The only real work I have left is figuring out my neutrals!

It’s almost ironic that my first foray into “color theory” is focused on shades of gray. But it turns out that gray is a very useful color in web design. In fact, some design teams need [17 different versions of gray](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/sassy_grayscale) for their website. 

Elizabeth suggests using at least two: 

> For most of my web projects, I find having two shades of gray to be infinitely useful — one dark, one light. You’ll use them a lot.
>
> The dark is usually used for text, and the light for when you need subtle differentiation against all that white (usually for backgrounds).

Easy enough. I was pleased to discover that Elizabeth doesn’t simply pick random shades of gray and leave it. Instead, she mixes her primary color into two random shades of gray. 

In more technical terms, she subtly adds hue to an “[achromatic gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_gray#Achromatic_grays),” transforming it into a “warm gray” or a “cool gray.” This creates harmony between the neutrals and the primary color on the rest of the site. 

Here’s the breakdown of her method:

1. Create two shapes and fill them with #424242 and #fafafa.
2. Insert a color fill layer above your two shapes.
3. Change that fill to your base color.
4. Set the blending mode to overlay, and bring the opacity right down to between 5 and 40% (in the example below, it’s set at 40%).
5. Use the color picker and copy your new values.

Elizabeth also notes that “this method works exceptionally well when your overlay color is blue. For any other color, you will want to either bring the opacity right down to 5 to 10% or stick with your original grays.”

I’ve also seen this technique used to tint an entire color palette, connecting every separate swatch with a single color.

I’m sure I’ll try that out at some point. But for now, my final color palette looks like this:

I also added white into the color palette because I’ll be using it for the website. 

I am slightly suspicious that I’ll need one or two more colors. But I can easily add in some sort of orange, if it comes to it. 

The beauty of learning how to create rich grays by mixing in the primary color is that I also learned how to mix the primary color with black and white to create tints and shades. 

Adding a spectrum for each color will add versatility and depth to the design, while keeping everything "on brand" and harmonious. Which is especially useful when it comes to the primary color:
