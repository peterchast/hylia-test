## Q: I can’t seem to find the narwhal socks?

**A:** If you showed up looking for actual socks printed with cute little narwhals on them, I sincerely apologize. Please understand that I wasn’t intentionally trying to trick the search engines when I named this site. Actually, I didn't name it with much intention whatsoever. 

But I did foresee the possibility of wayward traffic showing up, so I took some time to help you with your search for narwhal socks. [These ones are pretty sweet](https://www.amazon.com/K-Bell-Culture-Slapstick-Socks/dp/B07M7NBC9D/).
