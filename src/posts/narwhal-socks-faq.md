That’s a big bite to chew. Why not choose between web developer and graphic designer?

As I see it, web development and web design are tightly interwoven tracts. One informs the other in interesting and creative ways (and vice versa). There’s a very compelling “greater than the sum of the parts” argument in here somewhere. Maybe I’ll circle back at some point.

Learning web development is probably the more straightforward of the two. There are endless lists of tutorials (here’s one) with which I can pick up proficiency in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the many many related technologies and skills I will require.

Mastery of design theory, however, seems a rather nebulous endeavor, which means hours spent plunging into possibly unproductive rabbit holes of information I don’t totally understand. It is a pastime at which I am already adept, so whether I emerge on the other side a deep thinking designer or not, it should be fun.

What’s up with the name, Narwhal Socks?

I bought the domain a year or two ago with the intention of using it as a part of an intricate internet treasure hunt I wanted to build as a delivery system for my girlfriend’s Christmas present.

Long story short, her brother built a physical treasure hunt complete with an advent calendar that transformed into a puzzle box. I knew my plans had been upstaged, and abandoning the entire project was the obvious choice.

And now I may as well make use of the domain name

Why should you (dear reader) care about anything on this blog?

Well, if you aren’t me from the future, searching for that warm fuzzy feeling one gets whilst reminiscing about a period of incredible personal growth… you probably won’t care about anything on this blog.

Unless…

1. You showed up looking for actual socks printed with cute little narwhals on them. I apologize.

2. You, like me, also have a thirst for front-end development & design knowledge and landed on this blog in search of information, likely in the form of a step-by-step tutorial.

In which case: You might be sorely disappointed because I’m sure I won’t be writing any step-by-step tutorials on this blog. I must have picked up some accidental search engine recognition

You can click here to find a curated list of all the resources I have used.

3. You’re a prospective employer of my future self looking extra deep into my references.

In which case: You should know that the future me is a hard-worker, team player, and all around great employee to have around.
