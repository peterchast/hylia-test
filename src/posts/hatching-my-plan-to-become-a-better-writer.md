I have a number of stretch-beyond-frontend-design-&-development goals for this project. Some, like picking up Python and machine-learning are rather ambitious (and barely relevant). Others, like the desire to become a better writer, are fundamental and pervade every facet of this project and even my life in general. 

So I suppose I’ll work on the latter. Specifically, I’ll look to improve my writing in the following areas:

## Be concise and direct

This is the top priority. A former English teacher once called my writing “lush,” a euphemism to be sure. I have a tendency to overwrite. And also to chase semi-relevant digressions. Gods of design please grant me the fortitude to murder my darlings. 

I also suffer from the unfortunate habit of using passive voice, a pattern which I’d like to interrupt (maybe using this) as soon as possible.

## Entertain, but with purpose

How do I make my writing more entertaining? Clever jokes? Humorous yet surprisingly relevant anecdotes? Maybe. But I also want to avoid sacrificing narrative momentum for the sake of wisecracking and one-liners.  

Here’s my hope: that the more comfortable I become with writing about design & development, the more my A+ personality 🙃 and unique perspective will shine through, on the sentence level. 

## Find more connections

The secret to deep, interesting, useful writing is in consistently making intelligent and creative connections. Sascha from Zettlekasten.de sums it up well in his post about “The Barbell Method of Reading”:

If you are a journalist and read the story of Martin Strel and don’t connect it to research on meditation, other extreme athletes, or post-traumatic growth, you’ll only write a shallow story about him.

## Write efficiently

Writing anything, even a simple 342 word post, often takes me hours. As I continue to evaluate and tweak my writing process, I desperately need to find a few ways to speed it up.

My current plan is to focus on writing more complete rough drafts. Overcomplete, even. I’d like to be spending more time revising a rough draft than writing it.
