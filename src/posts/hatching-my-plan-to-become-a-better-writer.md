I have a number of stretch-beyond-frontend-design-&-development goals for this project. Some, like picking up Python and machine-learning are rather ambitious (and barely relevant). Others, like the desire to become a better writer, are fundamental and pervade every facet of this project and even my life in general. 

So I suppose I’ll work on the latter. Specifically, I’ll look to improve my writing in the following areas:

## Be concise and direct

This is the top priority. A former English teacher once called my writing “lush,” a euphemism to be sure. I have a tendency to overwrite. And also to chase semi-relevant digressions. Gods of design please grant me the fortitude to murder my darlings. 

I also suffer from the unfortunate habit of using passive voice, a pattern which I’d like to interrupt ([maybe using this](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)) as soon as possible.

## Entertain, but with purpose

How do I make my writing more entertaining? Clever jokes? Humorous yet surprisingly relevant anecdotes? Maybe. But I also want to avoid sacrificing narrative momentum for the sake of wisecracking and one-liners.  

Here’s my hope: that the more comfortable I become with writing about design & development, the more my A+ personality 🙃 and unique perspective will shine through, on the sentence level. 

## Find more connections

The secret to deep, interesting, useful writing is in consistently making intelligent and creative connections. Sascha from Zettlekasten.de sums it up well in his post about “[The Barbell Method of Reading](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/barbell-method-reading/)”:

If you are a journalist and read the story of Martin Strel and don’t connect it to research on meditation, other extreme athletes, or post-traumatic growth, you’ll only write a shallow story about him.

## Write efficiently

Writing anything, even a simple 342 word post, often takes me hours. As I continue to evaluate and tweak my writing process, I desperately need to find a few ways to speed it up.

My current plan is to focus on writing more complete rough drafts. Overcomplete, even. I’d like to be spending more time revising a rough draft than writing it.
