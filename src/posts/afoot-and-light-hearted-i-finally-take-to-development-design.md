> For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.
> ― Aristotle

I’ve decided to commit a (sizable?) portion of my life to learning the art of front end development & design. 

My goal is to learn by doing, in accordance with Aristotle’s advice offered above. Luckily, there are endless lists of tutorials that will help me pick up proficiency in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the many many related technologies and skills. 

I also want to dive deep into design theory, a rather nebulous endeavor into which I’ll sink countless hours without quantifiable return, I’m sure. 

I plan to invest each of these newly learned skills into the design and functions of this site, performing renovations as I am able, as well as record each of the journey’s milestones as blog posts. 

In several ways, therefore, the state of this blog will be a measuring stick of my progress. And, eventually, it will become a monument to my overall success or failure.
