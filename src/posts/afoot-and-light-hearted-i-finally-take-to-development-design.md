I’ve decided to commit a (sizable?) portion of my life to learning the art of front end development & design. 

I plan to learn by doing—in accordance with Aristotle’s advice offered above—using a mixed strategy of taking on bite-sized projects or tutorials, and studying theory in between. 

I will then invest my newly learned skills into the design and functions of this website, performing renovations and uploading blog post updates as I am ready and able.

In several ways, therefore, the state of Narwhal Socks will be a measuring stick of my progress. And, eventually, it will become a monument to my overall success or failure as a web designer.
